categories:
  - Triggers
options:
  - name: Interact Time
    description: Determines the length of interaction required to activate the device.
    notes: |
      The transmission of the button being activated *may* still be delayed by the **Delay** option.
    choices:
      - name: Instant
        isDefault: True
      - name: 1..10,15,20 Seconds
        description: The player must Interact with the button for the specified amount of time.
        notes: |
          Use one of these values if you want the player to have to focus on the button for a period of time before it transmits a signal. This can make the interaction more dangerous and tense.
  - name: Activating Team
    description: Determines which team can activate the device.
    choices:
      - name: Any
        description: A player's team does not matter for activating this device.
        isDefault: True
      - name: 1..16
        description: Only a player from the specified team number may activate this device.
  - name: Times Can Trigger
    description: The number of times this device can be triggered before being disabled.
    notes: |
      Once a Button has been disabled due to its Time Can Trigger limit, it cannot be re-enabled again by sending a signal to Enable When Receiving From.

      To create a button that is disabled when it is used but can be still re-enabled by another device in the future:

      - Set Time Can Trigger to Infinite
      - Use the same Channel number for the following options:
        - When Interacted With Transmit On
        - Disable When Receiving From

      This will disable the button right after it has been used. You can now use another device to re-enable the button at a later time.
    choices:
      - name: Infinite
        description: There is no limit to how many times this button can be activated, assuming it is enabled.
        isDefault: True
      - name: 1..10
        description: The button can only be activated the specified number of times.
  - name: Delay

      - name: 1..3, 5, 10, 20, 30 Seconds, 1..3, 5, 10, 15, 20 Minutes
        description: The button waits the specified time before sending a signal.
  - name: Reset Delay
    description: Specifies the length of time the device must wait after sending a signal before it can be triggered again.

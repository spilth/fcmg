  When Player A eliminates Player B:

  - Player A is the **Eliminating Actor** (the killer)
  - Player B is the **Eliminated Actor** (the killed)
  - If a player gets themselves killed they are both actors.

  An **Elimination Manager** uses the **Team** and **Class** of the **Eliminated Actor** to determine if it should be activated based on the values of **Activating Team** and **Class Identifier**. This allows you to use multiple Elimination Managers to target different Teams and/or Classes.

  If items are added to Elimination Manager these items will spawn when a player is eliminated according to the settings of **Number of Items Dropped**, **Spawn on Self Elimination** and **Toss Items**.

  It also has the ability to transmit signals when items are picked up and pass on separate signals for the **Eliminating Actor** (On Elimination) and the **Eliminated Actor** (When Eliminated)

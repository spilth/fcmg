overview: |
  Conditional Buttons allow you to set up a more complex interaction in your game. In this example we'll create a door that needs 3 nearby Jewels. Once the third Jewel has been provided a success sound will play and the door will unlock and open, allowing the player to access the inside of the room.

  The Lock and the Conditional Button will both be colored yellow to help associate them in a player's mind. We'll also play a sound once the lock/door has been opened in order to notify the player.

    items:
      - Jewel
exercises:
  - Add a **HUD Message Device** that displays a congratulatory message to just the Player that opened the door.
  - Try using Coins instead of Jewels to open the door. This will require two things. a) You will need to **Clear Items** from the existing **Conditional Button** before dropping the coin on it. b) You will need to set **My Island / Settings / Infinite Resources** to **Off** otherwise players start with an infinite number of coins.
  - Add another **Conditional Button** that closes and locks the door when it has been given 2 jewels. Note - It should only be usable once the door has been unlocked and opened.

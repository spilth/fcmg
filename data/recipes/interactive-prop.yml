overview: |
  While buttons are great for a number of interactions, they can be a little uninspiring if they're the only way to interact with things throughout your map.

  One way to make using them a little more exciting is placing them on a prop that looks interactive (like a computer console or machine) and then making the button invisible so the interaction shows up "on top" of the prop.

  Additionally, if you increase the **Interaction Radius** beyond **Button** then the player won't have to look at a very specific part of the prop to interact with it.

  In the recipe we'll make a computer console that players can "hack" to display a message via their HUD.
props:
  - name: Computer Console
  - gallery: Agency Props
devices:
  - name: Hackable Computer
    device: Button
    placement: |
      Place the Button so that it is located on the keyboard/interface of the computer console.

      Tip: Ensure that **Drops** is set to **Off** to prevent the button from dropping to the ground
    options:
      - name: Interact Time
        value: 5 Seconds
      - name: Text
        value: Hack the System
      - name: Visible During Game
        value: "No"
      - name: Interaction Radius
        value: .25M
    transmitters:
      - name: When Interacted With Transmit On
        channel: 1
  - name: Password Message
    device: HUD Message Device
    options:
      - name: Message
        value: The password is 123456
      - name: Message Recipient
        value: Triggering Player
      - name: Time From Round Start
        value: "Off"
    receivers:
      - name: Show When Receiving From
        channel: 1
exercises:
  - Make the hacking interaction take longer.
  - Change the style and placement of the message.
  - Change the Button so that the system can only be hacked once.
  - Change the displayed message to "The system has been hacked!" and have it displayed to everybody in the game, not just the interacting player.
